# ==Lab04 - For Loops ==

These are the projects I created to demonstrate my knowledge of For loops. I also started using logical AND (&&) and logical OR (||)

### Excercise 1

This program will allow a user to see the ASCII representation of a specific number they want or to see all the ASCII conversions from 33 to 126

### Excercise 2

This program will output the desired number of numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

### Excercise 3

This program will ask the user for what day they want a count of people with the flu for and will display the amount. It uses a similar growth pattern to the FIbonacci sequence.
