# ==Lab06 - Arrays, Strings, and File I/O ==

These projects are when I started to implement **arrays**, **strings**, and **file I/O**.

### Exercise 1

Creat an array of 5 doubles asking users to input values for the array. Display the values back to the user and then calculate sum, average, min and max for the array of doubles.

### Exercise 2

Let user decide how long array of strings is and display the longest and shortest string.

### Exercise 3

Create a program that reads the first value from another file and tells

-     	  you how many values are in the file, then create an array to store all
-     	  of those values. Allow user to search whether a value is in the array
-     	  or not.

### Exercise 4

Get an array from an existing file, and then write information to 2 new files one including the data normalized and the other with the data reversed.
