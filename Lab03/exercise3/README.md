# ==Lab03 - ==

This project is what I created when I first learned `if, else, elseif` statements.

### Exercise 1

This program will obtain a wind speed from the user and output what category hurracane it is

### Exercise 2

Obtain a numerator and denominator from the user and display the result of long division

### Exercise 3

This program will ask user if they want Tacos, sushi, and deserts and how many they want. It will then generate a receipt based on their age, any discounts, and the tax.
